# Problem Spaces

## Event discovery & personalization
- **Need**: Help attendees find the most relevant MSR projects, demos, and sessions fast.
- **User questions**: "Which demos match my research area?", "What should I see in the next 90 minutes near Building X?"
- **Ignite 2025 tech**: Graph People/Calendar/Insights, Work IQ memories, Agent 365 policies, Edge Copilot Mode for multitab comparisons, Foundry Agent Service for routing to recommender sub-agent.

## Project deep dives & synthesis
- **Need**: Summarize research projects, papers, and BoN-style content into briefs, FAQs, and decks.
- **User questions**: "Summarize all Fabric-related research demos", "Create a 3-slide exec brief on Agent 365 research applications".
- **Ignite 2025 tech**: Fabric IQ / Foundry IQ semantic retrieval, Word/PPT agents, Copilot Notebooks, SharePoint page creation via MCP, Work IQ for memory of prior reads.

## Cross-surface continuity
- **Need**: Seamless handoff across Edge → Teams → Outlook → Windows Ask Copilot → Copilot Chat without losing context or citations.
- **User questions**: "Continue my Edge research thread in Teams", "Email my saved schedule with citations".
- **Ignite 2025 tech**: Agent 365 identity + policies, Work IQ cross-surface memory, Edge Copilot Mode context handoff, Teams channel agents, Outlook Copilot, Windows agent workspace connectors.

## Governance & agent fleet visibility
- **Need**: Admins must see which agents/tools are active, what data they touch, and enforce guardrails.

- **Ignite 2025 tech**: Agent 365, Entra Agent ID, Foundry Control Plane, telemetry/log MCP tools, Purview/Defender policies on tool outputs.

## Security & DLP for agents
- **Need**: Prevent leakage of confidential content across tools, tenants, and surfaces.

- **Ignite 2025 tech**: Purview labels and scanning, Defender for Cloud Apps, Entra Conditional Access for agents, Windows MCP for local file actions with policy, Power Apps MCP DLP policies.

## Event ops & authoring automation
- **Need**: Support organizers with fast authoring of pages, lists, schedules, and recap comms.
- **User questions**: "Draft a SharePoint page for tomorrow's MSR demos", "Generate an Outlook recap with citations".
- **Ignite 2025 tech**: SharePoint MCP tools (create page/list), Outlook Copilot, Power Platform MCP, Copilot Studio evaluations for authoring flows.
