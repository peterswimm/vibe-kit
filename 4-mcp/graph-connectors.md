# Graph Connectors Guidance

- **People**: Use Graph People to understand roles, skills, org context; seed personalization and explain why a session fits the user.
- **Calendar**: Pull availability and location to avoid conflicts and optimize walking time; surface conflicts before scheduling.
- **Files**: Access relevant decks/notes (respecting labels) to ground recommendations and synthesis.
- **Org**: Use org hierarchy for stakeholder routing (who should see which demo), and to suggest intros.
- **Insights (signals)**: Combine Graph insights (views, edits, shares) with Work IQ memories to rank what matters most.
- **Work IQ overlay**: Treat Work IQ as the intelligence layer on top of Graph—cache relevant memories, avoid re-asking, and cite Work IQ provenance so users trust the ranking.
- **Policy**: All Graph calls go through Agent 365/Entra Agent ID; log intents and apply Purview/Defender checks on any cross-tenant data movement.
