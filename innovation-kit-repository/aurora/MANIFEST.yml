  instructions_markdown: |
    1. **Reload the VS Code window** with CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Developer: Reload Window. This will ensure that the GitHub Copilot customizations are loaded.
    2. **Switch chat modes** – In GitHub Copilot Chat, set the mode (CTRL+.) to one of the custom Aurora chat modes (start with Aurora Forecast).
    3. **Let Copilot guide the quick start** – Ask the Aurora chat mode to walk you through the Norway example; it will surface the right snippets, tasks, and docs when you need them.
    4. **Open the quick-start docs** – Keep `.vibe-kit/innovation-kits/aurora/docs/quick-start.md` handy while Copilot leads you through running the first forecast.
    5. **Decide your path** – Once the example runs, have Copilot suggest whether to follow the customization track (`docs/prototyping-guide.md`) or the from-scratch track (`docs/aurora-prototyping-guide.md`) based on your goal.
