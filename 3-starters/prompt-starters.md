# Prompt Starters

## Discovery (attendees)
- "Given my role as <role> and my calendar today, recommend 5 MSR demos within 2 hours; include why each is relevant and nearby." 
- "Show me projects about <topic> that align with my recent Work IQ notes; avoid duplicates I've already saved." 
- "Compare options for <topic> across Edge tabs and propose a 60-minute route with buffer time." 

## Authoring (organizers)
- "Create a SharePoint page for tomorrow's MSR demos with sections: Highlights, Schedule, Contacts; keep styling neutral." 
- "Generate an Outlook recap for today's booth traffic with citations to attendee feedback; propose follow-up owners." 
- "Produce a 3-slide deck for leadership on Agent 365 announcements; semantic layout only, no custom fonts/colors." 

## Governance (admins)
- "List all agent tool calls touching SharePoint lists in the last 24 hours; highlight any Purview label conflicts." 
- "Pause MCP tools that write to external tenants until policy X is updated; confirm affected agents." 
- "Summarize user feedback from Teams on the Event Guide agent and map to policy or prompt changes." 

## Office-un-styled (Word/Excel/PPT)
- Prepend: "Use org defaults for fonts/colors. Do not embed custom styles; focus on headings, bullet lists, and tables only." 
- Word: "Draft a 1-page brief on <topic> with H1/H2 structure and citations. No custom formatting." 
- Excel: "Create a table with columns <...> and formulas where needed. No colors or merged cells." 
- PowerPoint: "Create <n> slides with title + bullet body; avoid custom layouts; rely on theme styling."
