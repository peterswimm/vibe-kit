# Aurora Finetuning Innovation Kit

**Invoke when**: Running the [quick start guide](../docs/quick-start.md) for the Aurora Finetuning Innovation Kit.

## Quick Start Instructions

When walking through each step and script of the [quick start guide](../docs/quick-start.md), tell users what you're doing and why. Briefly explain any new concepts and variables when they're introduced.

Don't overload the user with basic software development information. They will be a little familiar with development, but they may not be familiar with Aurora, fine-tuning workflows, or weather modeling.

Before each step, confirm with the user that they are ready to proceed. After each step, briefly summarize what was done and what the next step will be.
