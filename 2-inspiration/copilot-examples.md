# Copilot Examples (Event Scenarios)

## Word / Excel / PowerPoint Agents
- **Word (recap)**: "Draft a 1-page recap of today's MSR demos with citations. Use headings only; no custom fonts or colors. Pull context from my Work IQ memories from Ignite."
- **Excel (attendee list tidy)**: "Clean this attendee export, dedupe by alias, and mark interests by matching against Work IQ keywords. Keep formatting minimal; no conditional color fills."
- **PowerPoint (brief)**: "Create a 5-slide deck for leadership on Agent 365 launches at Ignite 2025, using the Book of News content. Semantic layout only—let the org theme style it."

## Copilot Pages & Copilot Notebooks
- **Pages**: "Generate a SharePoint page summarizing all Fabric IQ sessions relevant to data scientists. Include links and citations; do not embed custom styling."
- **Notebooks**: "In Copilot Notebook, build a chain that fetches my calendar, checks session conflicts, and proposes an optimized route for MSR demos. Explain each step."

## Copilot Chat agent mode (Word/Excel/PPT)
- **Word agent mode**: "Within this doc, summarize the linked research paper into 3 bullets and add a references section. Keep styling neutral."
- **Excel agent mode**: "Analyze the session feedback sheet, find top requests by role, and propose next-day changes. Return a new table; no cell colors."
- **PPT agent mode**: "Add a slide after 'Roadmap' that compares Fabric IQ vs Foundry IQ benefits for event agents."

## Outlook Copilot
- **Email triage**: "Summarize unread event emails from today, highlighting actions tied to MSR demos. Suggest replies and slot times on my calendar." 
- **Scheduling**: "Propose 30-minute 1:1s with project leads I bookmarked in Edge during Ignite; avoid conflicts and include Teams links."

## SharePoint creation via Chat
- **Lists**: "Create a SharePoint list 'MSR Demo Follow-ups' with columns: Title, Owner, Booth, Priority, DueDate. Populate with my bookmarked demos."
- **Pages**: "Draft a page for the 'Edge Copilot Mode' demo including summary, key benefits, and a 'Try it' section. Use sections only; let the theme style it."

## Cross-surface flow example
1. In Edge Copilot Mode, ask: "Compare these three demo pages and save the best two to my Work IQ." 
2. Switch to Teams channel agent: "Share my saved picks to the #msr-event team and ask for volunteers to staff them." 
3. In Outlook Copilot: "Invite the volunteers to 15-minute syncs tomorrow; include the saved page links." 
4. In Windows Ask Copilot: "Download the decks for the confirmed demos to my Event folder and open them."
