# Application Patterns

## Personal Schedule Assistant
User provides free windows; agent recommends optimal learning path minimizing walking.

## Team Shared Route
Aggregate interests of multiple teammates; produce merged itinerary and highlight consensus sessions.

## Executive Brief Pack
Rank sessions + demos aligning with strategic themes (e.g., AI safety) and author a SharePoint summary.

## Live Re-Ranking
As sessions fill or user calendar changes, re-run scoring and notify of better alternatives.

## Post-Event Knowledge Capture
After event, compile attended sessions into a knowledge page with links to recordings and notes.
